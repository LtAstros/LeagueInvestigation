    "# League of Legends Competitive Match Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Summoner's Rift!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will look at a dataset of 100,000 rows that contain information on players and teams from over 10,000 League of Legends competitive matches. There are many questions that can be answered such as the following:\n",
    "- Looking at [tier one professional leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_League_of_Legends_leagues_and_tournaments), which league has the most \"action-packed\" games and for that league, is it's level of \"action\" significantly different than the others (you will have to quantify \"action\")?\n",
    "- Which league of legends competitive region has the highest win rate against teams outside their region? Note you will have to find region data for this question as the dataset does not have it.\n",
    "- Which role \"carries\" (does the best) in their team more often, ADCs (Bot lanes) or Mid laners?\n",
    "- Is Costin's favorite champion (Talon) more likely to win or lose a match based on this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you wanted to pursue this dataset, it would be worthwhile to have some existing knowledge about League of Legends and its terminology. Also, this data should not require insight into the competitive side of League of Legends to still have interesting questions (refer to the last two example questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Data\n",
    "The dataset can be found on the [Oracle's Elixir](https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to get the most up-to-date match data file with more than 100,000 rows. If you wanted to use older datasets feel free to do so but keep in mind that League of Legends changes its games in drastic ways between years making it harder to compare between years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning and EDA\n",
    "- Clean the data.\n",
    "    - Note that each `gameid` has up to 12 rows, one for each of the 5 players on both teams and 2 containing summary data for the two teams (try to find out what distinguishes those rows). After selecting the line of inquiry, make sure to remove either the player rows or the team rows so as not to have issues later in your analysis.\n",
    "    - Many columns that should be of type `bool` but are not.\n",
    "- Understand the data in ways relevant to your question using univariate and bivariate analysis of the data as well as aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment of Missingness\n",
    "- Assess the missingness per the requirements in `project03.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Test / Permutation Test\n",
    "Find a hypothesis test or permutation test to perform. You can use the questions at the top of the notebook for inspiration."
